Mark IV Aldebaran

Contents: Build files for Mark IV Ammo-Case PC case, nicknamed "Aldebaran"

Built to fit a standard steel 50 caliber ammunition case, easily findable at local army surplus stores. Files in DXF format, to be used on a lasercutter or CNC machine of your choice. This example was cut with a 140-watt laser cutter, with a beam width set to 1mm. Power and speed settings vary from machine to machine, so they are left out of this readme.

System specs: (backplate specifically designed for this motherboard IO layout)
